## Introduction this app 

## Splash Screen: 
  The splash screen is typically the first screen that users see when they launch the app. It often displays the app's logo or a brief loading animation and serves as an introductory screen before the main application loads.
  
## Home Screen: 
  The home screen is the central hub of the app where users can access various features and navigate to different sections of the application. It usually provides an overview of the app's main content and functionality.
  
## Product Details Screen: 
  This screen displays detailed information about a specific product, including its name, description, price, images, and user reviews. Users can typically view product details and make purchase decisions on this screen.
  
## Login Screen: 
 The login screen is where users can enter their credentials (e.g., username and password) to access their accounts or specific features of the app. It's a crucial component for apps that require user authentication.
  
## Loading Screen:
 A loading screen appears when the app is retrieving data or performing time-consuming tasks. It informs users that the app is working in the background and provides a visual indication of progress.
  
## Cart Screen: 
  The cart screen allows users to view and manage items they've added to their shopping cart before making a purchase. Users can often adjust quantities, remove items, or proceed to checkout from this screen.
  
## OTP Verify Screen: 
 This screen is typically used for one-time password (OTP) verification, often sent to a user's mobile number or email during the registration or login process. Users enter the OTP here to verify their identity.
  
## Popular Product Screen:
  This screen showcases a selection of products that are currently popular among users. It can help users discover trending or highly-rated items.
  
## Special Product Screen: 
  Similar to the popular product screen, this screen highlights special or featured products that the app wants to promote, such as seasonal offers or exclusive items. 
  
## New Product Screen:
  This screen displays newly added or recently released products in the app's catalog. It helps users stay updated on the latest offerings.
  
## Reviews Screen: 
   Users can read and write product reviews on this screen. It often displays user-generated content, including ratings, comments, and feedback about products.
  
## Create Review Screen: 
This screen allows users to write and submit their reviews and ratings for products they've purchased or used. It may include text fields, star ratings, and image uploads.
  
## Categories List: 
  Users can add products they are interested in but not ready to purchase to their wish list. This screen allows users to manage and view their saved items for future reference.
    
## Wish List: 
 This screen provides a list of product categories or sections within the app, making it easier for users to browse and filter products based on their interests.

    
## Complete Profile Screen: 
  Users can update and manage their profile information, including personal details, shipping addresses, and notification preferences on this screen.
